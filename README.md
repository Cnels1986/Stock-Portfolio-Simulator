# Stock Portfolio Simulator

This application will allow users to sign up and register for it. Once signed out, each user will be given $25,000 which will be used to buy whatever stocks they want. Using the IEX API, the app will be able to retrieve the up to date price for whatever stock the user enters. Users will also be able to sell their stocks at the current price and purchase more if desired. The goal being that each user will be trying to make the most profit while competing with each other. The app's dashboard will contain the information of the user, the stocks they own, and how the compare to the other users of the app.
